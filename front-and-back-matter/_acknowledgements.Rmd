Without the support of many people, I would not be able to finish this study. I am too grateful for their contribution and owe big thanks to all of them.\
The internet is full of information, but it is tough to find good quality. I want to start with the creators of the tools that I have used for the thesis. I can not count how many times I used those sources; special thanks to those who created great content and made them accessible.\
Sometimes, you can not find the problem about your implementation, but sharing remarkable ideas with other colleagues may open another perspective on the problem. Hence, I want to thank all the members of the Goldt Lab and Data Science and Scientific Computing (DSSC) master program from the University of Trieste that we brainstormed together.\
Thanks to the lectures that I had from DSSC, I was comfortable enough to move on with this topic, so I want to present my appreciation to all professors of DSSC.\
All the process was crystal clear and organized, starting from our first meeting. I learned too much from him, and without his invaluable support, I could not finish this study on time. Therefore, special thanks to the head of the Goldt Lab and my esteemed supervisor, Sebastian. \
I must be grateful to all of my friends for helping me maintain social bonds. Nowadays, we realize how important it is. Thanks to their friendship, I could balance my study and social life in this challenging period and study more efficiently on this thesis.\
Finally, I want to present the last but enormous thanks to my family. They are always there when I need motivation or when I struggle with a problem.
